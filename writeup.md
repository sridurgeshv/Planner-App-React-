Introduction: 

The Todo widget I developed for the planning app is a valuable tool that greatly improves productivity and organization. It offers users a dedicated area to efficiently manage their tasks. This write-up effectively outlines the reasons behind its creation and its functionality.

Task Management: 
The Todo widget serves as a central hub for users to create, view, and mark tasks as completed, facilitating efficient task tracking.

Prioritisation: 
Users can organize tasks based on importance or urgency within the Todo widget, enabling them to prioritize and focus on critical deadlines and responsibilities.

Accountability:
The visible task list in the widget helps users hold themselves accountable, acting as a reminder and motivator to stay on top of their tasks.

To utilize the Todo widget:
Input task description and click "Add Task."
Mark tasks as complete by ticking the checkbox.
For more options, click the kebab menu (three vertical dots) beside each task.
Choose to delete or edit tasks from the menu.

Users may easily manage their chores, increase productivity, and maintain better organisation in their everyday life by putting the Todo widget into the planner app.
