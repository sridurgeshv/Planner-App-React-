### Introducing our All-in-One Productivity App for Developers

As developers, we require an efficient tool to manage numerous tasks and ideas in a unified manner. To meet this need, we have developed an all-in-one productivity app, incorporating a timer, to-do list, and calendar view. With this integrated solution, we can effectively plan, prioritize, and monitor our progress, empowering us as aspiring developers.
### Insights Of Application

We have meticulously designed distinct JavaScript files for each widget, including clock, calendar, reminder list, and timer. Moreover, our WidgetGalleryModal provides a user-friendly modal view, enabling seamless addition of new widgets to the main screen.

In every web-based project, it is essential to incorporate basic default styles for consistent application development. In App.js, we utilize the "area" property to control the positioning of widgets, offering four options: "none-widget," "left-widget," "main-widget," and "right-widget." We implement the <Draggable> component to enable floating widgets that can be freely moved across the application when not locked onto the prefixed positions.

Finally, we have deployed our application on the Internet using Google Firebase, a reliable web hosting provider with powerful features for app deployment, real-time database, authentication, and cloud functions, ensuring seamless scalability and performance.
